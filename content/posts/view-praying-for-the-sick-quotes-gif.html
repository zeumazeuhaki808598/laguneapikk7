                Touch me, o lord, and fill me with your light and your hope. A prayer for the sick (an inspiring short prayer for someone to pray for a friend or family member who is sick or in ill health) father, your love is as wide as the oceans as deep as the sea and as tall as the heavens. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the lord will raise him up.

    <h3>Healing was purchased in the atonement and is available, just as salvation is available.</h3>
    <p>Beloved, i pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul. 3 john 1:2 the bible tells us to pray for healing from god and we will be blessed with health and strength to overcome whatever pain we face. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the lord will raise him. Sickness is a part of human nature and human life. I ask that you help heal them and bring back their strength.</p>
